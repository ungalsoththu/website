**Phase:** 01-foundation (Foundation)
**Status:** Plans created, ready to execute
**Location:** .planning/phases/01-foundation/

Phase 1 planning is complete. All 4 PLAN.md files have been created with 14 total tasks. No code has been written yet - this is still greenfield (repo only has planning docs).

The plans follow the RESEARCH.md recommendations:
- Astro 5.x with built-in i18n (not external plugins)
- GitHub Actions deployment with withastro/action@v5
- Bilingual routing: / (English) and /ta/ (Tamil)
- Content collections for type-safe markdown content

</current_state>

<completed_work>

- **Research Phase:** Complete (01-RESEARCH.md)
  - Astro vs 11ty comparison
  - i18n patterns documented
  - GitHub Pages deployment patterns identified

- **Planning Phase:** Complete (01-01 through 01-04 PLAN.md)
  - 01-01: Astro Project & i18n Setup (3 tasks)
  - 01-02: GitHub Actions Deployment (3 tasks)
  - 01-03: Layouts & Language Switcher (3 tasks)
  - 01-04: Content Collections Structure (5 tasks)

  - All 4 PLAN.md files committed
  - 14 total tasks defined
  - Ready for execution

</completed_work>

**Phase 1 Execution** (0/4 plans complete):

1. Execute 01-01-PLAN.md: Initialize Astro project with i18n config
2. Execute 01-02-PLAN.md: Set up GitHub Actions deployment
3. Execute 01-03-PLAN.md: Create layouts and language switcher
4. Execute 01-04-PLAN.md: Set up content collections

**No code exists yet.** The repo only contains:
- Planning documentation (.planning/)
- README.md
- .claude/ config

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**From RESEARCH.md (already decided):**
- **SSG:** Astro 5.x (better i18n DX than 11ty)
- **i18n:** Built-in Astro i18n routing (not @astrojs/i18n plugin)
- **URL structure:** / (English), /ta/ (Tamil) - prefixDefaultLocale: false
- **Base path:** /website (for GitHub Pages subdirectory)
- **Deployment:** withastro/action@v5 (official GitHub Action)

**Planning decisions:**
- Split Phase 1 into 4 plans (each 2-3 tasks for ~50% context target)
- Kept language switcher simple - no client JS (server-side routing only)
- Minimal styles in Phase 1 - full design system in Phase 2
- Single blog collection to demonstrate pattern (more collections in Phase 3)

</decisions_made>

None. All plans are clear and ready to execute.

**Project: UngalSoththu** ("This is Your Asset")
- Bilingual (Tamil + English) static website
- Urban transit accountability in Chennai/Tamil Nadu
- GitHub Pages hosting (must be pure static)
- LLM/agent-friendly content workflow

**The Approach:**
Phase 1 establishes the technical foundation:
1. Astro setup with i18n routing
2. Automated deployment pipeline
3. Base layout with language switcher
4. Content collections pattern

After Phase 1, the site will be functional but minimal. Phase 2 will add typography and Tamil fonts.

**Current State:**
- Plans are committed (256bf10)
- Ready to execute first plan: 01-01-PLAN.md
- All context from RESEARCH.md is baked into the plans

<next_action>

**To resume work, run:** `/gsd:execute-plan .planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

This will:
1. Initialize Astro project with `npm create astro@latest`
2. Configure i18n routing for en/ta
3. Create temporary homepage
4. Verify dev server works

**Recommendation:** Run `/clear` before executing to start with fresh context.
