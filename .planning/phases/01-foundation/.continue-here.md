**Phase:** 01-foundation (Foundation)
**Status:** Research complete, ready for planning

Session completed the ecosystem research for Phase 1. No code has been written yet - this is pure research and planning preparation. The project is still at the greenfield stage (empty directory except for planning docs).

**What was done:**
1. Researched Astro vs 11ty static site generators
2. Compared i18n capabilities for bilingual (Tamil + English) sites
3. Documented GitHub Pages deployment patterns
4. Identified common pitfalls and anti-patterns
5. Created comprehensive RESEARCH.md with verified findings

</current_state>

<completed_work>

- **Research Phase:** Complete
  - Astro 5.x: Built-in i18n routing, official GitHub Actions, large ecosystem
  - 11ty v3.1.2: Simpler, ~2.3x faster builds, bundled I18nPlugin
  - Decision: Astro recommended for this project (better i18n DX for bilingual sites)
  - GitHub Pages deployment patterns documented (withastro/action@v5)
  - Common pitfalls catalogued (pathPrefix issues, Tamil font rendering, mixed content)

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Next step:** Create PLAN.md files for Phase 1 execution

Phase 1 plans will cover:
1. Astro project initialization with i18n config
2. GitHub Pages deployment setup (GitHub Actions)
3. Bilingual directory structure setup
4. Basic layouts and language switcher component

No code has been written. The repo only has planning documentation.

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**Static Site Generator:** Choosing Astro over 11ty
- Rationale: Better i18n DX and documentation for multilingual sites
- Rationale: Stronger 2024-2025 ecosystem with official integrations
- Rationale: Component system better for LLM/agent-friendly content workflow
- Tradeoff: 11ty is ~2.3x faster build time, but not critical for this project size

**Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- Constraint: Must be static (no server-side code)
- Deployment: Official withastro/action@v5 GitHub Action

**Bilingual Structure:** Tamil + English
- Default: English (no URL prefix for /)
- Tamil: /ta/ prefix
- Using Astro's built-in i18n routing (v3+)

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

None. Research is complete and recommendations are clear.

**Project Context:**
- UngalSoththu ("This is Your Asset") - urban transit accountability in Chennai/Tamil Nadu
- Bilingual static website publishing content and data apps for public transit
- GitHub Pages hosting (static only, no backend)
- LLM/agent-friendly content workflow desired

**The Plan:**
1. Phase 1: Foundation (current) - SSG setup, GitHub Pages, bilingual structure
2. Phase 2: Design System - Typography, Tamil fonts, accessibility
3. Phase 3: Content Infrastructure - Markdown collections, layouts
4. Phase 4: Data Infrastructure - JSON/CSV data loading
5. Phase 5: Content Pages - About, campaigns, blog, reports
6. Phase 6: Mini App - Master data search (fleets, depots, routes)
7. Phase 7: Launch - WCAG audit, testing, deployment

**Mental Context:**
- This is the first phase of a 7-phase roadmap
- Research is DONE and HIGH confidence
- Next step is to run /gsd:plan-phase 01 to create executable PLAN.md files
- The RESEARCH.md created in this session will be auto-loaded during planning

</context>

<next_action>

**To resume work, run:** `/gsd:plan-phase 01`

This will:
1. Load the RESEARCH.md created in this session
2. Create executable PLAN.md files with specific tasks
3. Define verification steps and success criteria
4. Be ready for execution via /gsd:execute-plan

**File created:** `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-RESEARCH.md` (committed)
